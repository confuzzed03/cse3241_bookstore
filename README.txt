Notes

	Inside directory of this README.txt, there are a few things to note.
	"BookStore.sqlite" is the database that holds all our tables. It's imported and connected to by the Mozilla Firefox plugin, "SQLite Manager".
	Inside the "SQLite Files" folder, there is a file called "BookStore.sql" that holds all the SQL code for creating the tables in the above database.
	Running the "BookStore.sql" file should give you the tables along with the data saved inside them.
	The "Separate_Tables" folder holds all the SQL Code for creating each table separately. Provided for your convenience.
	However, "BookStore.sql" should hold all the SQL code to create all of them at once.
