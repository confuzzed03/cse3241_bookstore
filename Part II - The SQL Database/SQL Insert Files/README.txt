Each text file has the scripts needed to insert data for each table into the database. These scripts should be used once the table creation scripts have been employed.
You can directly copy these scripts and paste them into a SQLite command prompt or some other command line tool.
The sqlite_master text file should only be used if the binary file does not work in connecting the database (Firefox plugin). Other than that, this file is ignored in most cases.
